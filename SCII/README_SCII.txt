This is the Scooter Computer II application.

This is a Qt C++ cross platform application for add computing functionality
to Vespa scooters. The application is designed to run on a tablet pc connected
to a LabJack data aquistion device.

It is currently in prototype phase and the primary reason for the git repository
is to manage changes and allow easy deployment between my notebook and table.
