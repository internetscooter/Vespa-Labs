-= Scooter Computer II application =-


This is a Qt C++ cross platform application for add computing functionality
to Vespa scooters. The application is designed to run on a tablet pc connected
to a LabJack data aquistion device.

It is currently in prototype phase and the primary reason for the git repository
is to manage changes and allow easy deployment between my notebook and table.

EULA

This is experimental software and has absolutely NO WARRANTY. The fact that it
is a computer for scooters means that it should NEVER be used. It is illegal
in most places to operate a computer or electronic device while driving/riding.
At best it may be possible to legally use this software on some secret test track,
if you have the luxury of one of those then enjoy but don't expect the software
to work!
