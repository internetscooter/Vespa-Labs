This leverages the OpenFOAM motorcycle tutorial and adapts it to run Vespa simulations.

Work in progress.

7/3/2013

The vanilla motorcycle tutorial is copied, changed and run in a seperate directory. 

So far nothing "Vespa" is happening, once the motorbike tut has been optimised we'll move on.

TODO:

- mesh checking/fixing 
- snappyHex using VTK edge detection
- frontal area allocation with command line rendering
